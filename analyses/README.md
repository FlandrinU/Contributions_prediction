# README

This folder contains all analyses of the project.
Analyses are divided in 3 parts:

1- Extraction of species traits and species-level contributions for the RLS species-list,
    and inference of the missing data with Random Forest
    
2- Assessment of fish community contributions at the survey scale, and aggregation
    of all contributions at the site level
    
3- Modelling of contributions in a Bayesian framework, and construction of
    counterfactual scenarios
